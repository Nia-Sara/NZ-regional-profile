# NZ-regional-profile

This is a research project that takes NZ's regional statistics related to property investments and visualises on a single screen. This project is aimed at visualising the statistics on graphical notations such as graphs that could help people who are hunting properties for rental, buying or investment purpose to compare the trend of indicators throughout time and identify whether a region is well-fit to their preferences or the budget.
